# Notion Research Database Schema v1

Snapshot date: 2026-05-03

This document defines the database schema needed to reconstruct the Notion research system without copying any data. It includes database names, property names, property types, select options, relation setup, and rollup setup only.

## Scope

- Databases covered:
  - Research Ideas
  - Research Runs
  - Trading Proposals
- Excluded:
  - Page IDs, database IDs, data source IDs, property IDs, URLs, commands, prompts, raw rows, and workspace-specific artifacts.

## Research Ideas

Purpose: planning backlog and opportunity pipeline.

| Property | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Original Idea` | title | User-entered raw idea. Minimal input field. |

| `Status` | select | Execution state. Current options: `Queued`, `Running`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`. |
| `Processor` | select | Provider processor tier. Current options: `lite`, `pro-fast`, `ultra-fast`, `ultra`. |
| `Started At` | date | Timestamp when run was submitted or started. |
| `Completed At` | date | Timestamp when run reached a terminal state. |
| `Result URL` | url | External result or monitoring URL for the provider run. |
| `Prompt Used` | rich_text | Exact prompt submitted for this run. |
| `Executive Summary` | rich_text | Run-level executive summary. |
| `Previous Interaction ID` | rich_text | Prior provider interaction ID supplied only for follow-up runs. Blank for first-pass runs. |

## Trading Proposals

> **Canonical schema notice:** The property table below is **historical** (35-field v1 from 2026-05-03). Do not use this section for new reconstruction work.
>
> Canonical target: [`data/schema-notion-trading-proposals-simple.md`](schema-notion-trading-proposals-simple.md) — includes Layer 1 qualitative fields, Layer 2 pricing geometry, and workflow status fields.

Purpose: structured, reviewable trade hypotheses derived from research outputs. Each row represents a proposal or watchlist candidate for further user review, not an execution instruction.
