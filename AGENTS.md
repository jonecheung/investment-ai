# Personal Investment Assistant Instructions

This workspace is for personal investment research, planning, and assistant workflows. It is not a coding workspace. Treat all work here as analysis support, not financial, legal, or tax advice.

## Operating Preferences

These defaults control how the assistant should reason, prioritize, and communicate in this workspace.

- Default user-facing language: Hong Kong Traditional Chinese (unless user asks otherwise).
- Default market coverage: Hong Kong, Japan, and US.
- Default asset focus: equities, derivatives, ETFs, and crypto assets.
- When market conventions differ by region, always state market, currency, trading venue, timezone, and regulatory context.
- Apply weekend/weekday operating rhythm:
  - Weekend (Research Mode): generate ideas, run research, identify opportunities, and formulate plans.
  - Weekday (Execution Mode): prioritize execution, adjustments, and risk/trigger monitoring based on existing plans.

## System Configuration

These are technical/runtime defaults for tools, integrations, and workspace references. They are not authorization to perform external writes without confirmation.

| Key | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neon project name | `ai-investment` | Preferred Neon project for portfolio schema work |
| Portfolio schema proposal | `data/schema-portfolio-proposal.md` | Source of truth for schema details; confirm before applying changes |
| Notion ideas database | `Research Ideas` | Idea lifecycle and scheduling control |
| Notion runs database | `Research Runs` | Run-level execution log and audit trail |
| Tooling priority | CLI > `curl` API > MCP | MCP is fallback unless explicitly requested |
| Auth method | Environment variables, then `.env` | Prefer non-interactive auth for local/cloud agents |

## Workflow Standards

### Design Intent

- Separate idea lifecycle from execution history.
- `Research Ideas` is the planning backlog and opportunity pipeline.
- `Research Runs` is the execution log and audit trail.
- Keep cross-database linking stable with relation + generated IDs.

### Low-Friction Idea Input

- User input should be minimal: enter only `Original Idea`.
- System derives a single research-ready field (`Research Input`) and classification tags.
- Avoid duplicate semantic fields that serve the same purpose.

### Scheduling Model

For recurring opportunity scans, `Research Ideas` should use:

- `Active` (checkbox) to control scheduler inclusion.
- `Run Frequency` (select): `Once`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Biweekly`, `Monthly`, `Quarterly`.
- `Last Run At`, `Last Run ID`, and latest `Executive Summary` for recency and continuity.

### Output Standardization Policy (v1)

- Treat `Executive Summary` as the only guaranteed common output across research runs.
- Store `Result URL` in Notion as the pointer to full run outputs in Parallel.
- Do not store raw JSON payloads in Notion.
- Add new structured fields only after repeated stable output patterns are observed.

### Notion Linking Convention

- In `Research Ideas`, keep `Idea ID` as an auto-generated stable identifier.
- In `Research Runs`, link via `Idea` relation and use rollup for `Idea ID`.
- Do not maintain duplicate manual ID fields when rollup can provide the same value.

## Tooling & Authentication

- Prefer relevant project skills first when available.
- Default execution priority: CLI tools -> direct API calls via `curl` -> MCP tools (fallback, or when explicitly requested).
- For Notion operations, prefer Notion REST API via `curl`.
- For deep research operations, prefer `parallel-cli`.
- Skills: `notion-api`, `parallel-deep-research`
- CLI: `parallel-cli`, `git`, `npx skills`
- Direct API via `curl`: Notion API, AlphaVantage API
- MCP tools are secondary by default in this workspace.
- This workspace may run in local or cloud agents; prefer non-interactive authentication.
- Always check environment variables first, then `.env` (without exposing secret values) when a tool supports API key/token auth.
- Prefer API key/token authentication over manual login flows.
- If a tool only supports manual interactive login and has no non-interactive alternative, treat it as unavailable for cloud-agent execution unless the user provides another approved path.

## Safety & Change Control

- Do not place trades, move money, submit forms, open accounts, close accounts, change beneficiaries, or take any irreversible financial action.
- Do not provide personalized financial advice as a final recommendation. Present research, tradeoffs, risks, assumptions, and options for the user to evaluate.
- Ask for explicit confirmation before reading, summarizing, or using sensitive financial documents.
- Prefer read-only workflows by default.
- Before any write to Notion, databases, files, or external services:
  - summarize target objects (page/database/data source IDs where applicable),
  - summarize exact intended change and impact (create/update/archive/trash/delete),
  - and wait for explicit confirmation.
- Never blindly clear all parent page blocks when embedded databases may exist.
- Prefer non-destructive updates (append/replace text sections without removing database blocks).
- Do not hardcode secrets in `.cursor/mcp.json`, scripts, data files, or skill files.

## Research & Data Standards

- Cite sources for market data, company facts, filings, news, and third-party claims.
- Separate facts, assumptions, estimates, and opinions.
- Highlight uncertainty, conflicts between sources, stale data, and missing context.
- Prefer primary sources such as company filings, investor relations material, regulatory data, and official economic data when available.
- Do not overstate precision. Use ranges or scenarios when exact figures are not reliable.

## Portfolio Data Schema Guidance

- Keep workspace contents simple and centralized under `data/` unless explicitly approved otherwise.
- Use `data/` only for sanitized examples, schemas, derived summaries, or pointers to approved external sources.
- Never store credentials, API keys, access tokens, account numbers, SSNs, raw brokerage exports, statements, or tax files in this workspace or Neon.
- Initial portfolio storage target is Neon/Postgres.
- Treat `data/schema-portfolio-proposal.md` as the source of truth for schema details.
- Do not apply Neon schema/database changes without first summarizing intended changes and receiving explicit confirmation.

## Skills Policy

- Keep project-level skills under `.agents/skills/`.
- Skills can be managed in project scope with:
  - `npx skills list`
  - `npx skills add <source>`
  - `npx skills remove <skill-name>`
  - `npx skills add <source> --list`
- Before using a newly added skill that may access external services or private data, explain scope and ask for explicit confirmation.

### Skill Purpose In This Workspace (High Level)

- `notion-api`: use for building and maintaining the Notion research operating system (database structure, operational fields, and workflow documentation pages).
- `parallel-deep-research`: use for deep thematic research runs (primarily weekend research mode), including run tracking and summary capture.
- Use this section for workspace intent only; follow each skill's own documentation for execution details and API/CLI specifics.
